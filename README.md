### Hello there :sparkles:

I'm Simone, an Italian game developer currently living in Austria :grin:

:space_invader: I'm a gameplay programmer. I worked for three years on World of Tanks where I also covered the role of Tech Leader. At the moment I'm working on an announced UE5 title.
In the past I was a PhD student writing about players and their role in game communities, while the topic is still very interesting for me I realized the academic life was not for me.

- :clock4: In my free time I like to work on personal gaming project, read, cook, build gunpla and enjoy nature :sunflower:.
- ðŸŒ± Every day learning something new especially about gaming tech.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/simonepetrosino/)
Byee !
